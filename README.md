# BadgeRemover
Removes badges from app icons. WTFPL. iOS 7 only, but it's a piece of cake to backport.
Particularly useful for things like ActiveBoard, which (at the time of this writing) does not have an option to disable badges for some reason. Or a settings pane, for that matter.
Thanks to @Akadi_Nor for the icon and @insanj for asking him for it (and for coding help).
